###Course Project Information

###Things we need to do
- [ ] The system’s data structure is to contain a hashed table of at least 25 records read from a file.
- [x] Collisions will be resolved using separate chaining within each bucket.
- [ ] In addition to the hashed array, build a binary search tree with the same key as the hash table’s key and a second BST for the secondary key. For instance, in the Book example, one BST and the hash table will be built using ISBN, the unique key, and the other BST will be built using title, the secondary key.
- [ ] Draw a Data Structure Diagram to show the hash table of buckets and the two BSTs (make sure to show how data are shared).  Update this diagram depending on the variation of the project you have (i.e. number of students in your team).
- [ ] Data Diagrams
- [ ] Structure Charts
- [ ] UML
- [ ] Provide relevant test cases for the final presentation

Remember to do your peer evaluations on time. Check the schedule on her website.
Please make sure for every cin statement there is a check for if the input is valid. It will make debugging much easier later on.
